 * Description: Interface for an abstract scoreboard for keeping score for any 
 *              kind of competition with TWO or more competitors and AT LEAST 
 *              ONE period.
 *
 *              For a simple scoreboard, there may only be one period.
 *              However, some scoreboards will have multiple periods, such as
 *              some sports that have four periods (quarters) and the total
 *              score represents the sum total of all periods.
 *
 *              Competitors and periods are numbered in increasing order from 1
 *              so a scoreboard for a 9-inning baseball game will have
 *              competitors 1 and 2 with innings {1...9}, inclusive. 
 *
 *              Periods should initially have 0 score for all competitors.
 *
 *              See comments for each method for description on how they should
 *              behave and how to use the parameters
